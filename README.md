# VQA--Visual-Question-Answering
Visual Feature Extraction -> Optical Character Recognition ->Multi-Modal Fusion  -> Reasoning


1. Standard tables export are trained, non standard face problem
2. complex images reduces fusion capabilities
3. can build from scratch locally, better option to finetune a highly accurate and proper trained model
4. quantized model will be faster inference little accuracy can be sacrificed
