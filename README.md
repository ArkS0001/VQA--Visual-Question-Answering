# VQA--Visual-Question-Answering
Visual Feature Extraction -> Optical Character Recognition ->Multi-Modal Fusion  -> Reasoning


1. Standard tables export are trained, non standard face problem
2. complex images reduces fusion capabilities
3. can build from scratch locally, better option to finetune a highly accurate and proper trained model
4. quantized model will be faster inference little accuracy can be sacrificed

Okay, let's break down this process flow diagram for Volkswagen’s P3+ Anmeldepackage. It appears to be a complex workflow related to vehicle registration and potentially compliance processes. Here's an explanation of each section, based on the visual elements:

Overall Structure:

    Title & Header: "Prozessstandard" (Process Standard), “Relevante Einganggrößen für P3 + Anmeldungspakage erzeugen” (Relevant Input Sizes for P3+ Registration Package Creation) – Clearly states what the document is about. It also indicates it's internal VW documentation.
    Version/Page Info: OE: E02/2; Version: 01.00; Seite 11 von 11 - Tells us which version of the standard we are looking at and that it's page 11 out of 11 pages.
    Ablaufplan: This translates to 'Flow Chart'. The entire image represents a detailed flowchart outlining the steps involved.

Block Breakdown (Starting from Left):

Let's divide the chart into logical blocks. Note that due to the complexity and density, some interpretation might require understanding the context within VW's systems.

Section 1: Initial Steps / Triggering Events (Leftmost)

    Trigger Event Box ("Start"): A diamond shape labeled "Start". Indicates where the process begins—likely triggered by receiving a new customer request or data input.
    Data Intake (“Datenaufnahme”): Immediately after ‘start’, there’s a box labelled “Datenaufnahme”. This means initial data collection happens here. Likely involves gathering information like VIN, model details, etc.
    System Check (“Systemprüfung”): Next comes “Systemprüfung,” meaning system check. Checks if all required fields have been filled correctly. If not, the process loops back to data intake.
    Validation (“Validierung”): After System Check, you get Validation. Validates whether the provided data meets predefined criteria. Again, loop back to Data Intake if invalid.

Sections 2-6: Core Processing Blocks (Middle Area)

These sections represent the main processing stages. Each step has several parallel paths represented as branches. These pathways likely reflect different scenarios, variations in requirements, or specific departments involved. Let’s look at them generally:

    “Checkliste Prüfung” (Checklist Review): Several boxes representing checklist reviews. Different checklists seem focused on various aspects: technical specifications, legal compliance, financial checks, environmental regulations.
    “Dokumentation Erstellung” (Documentation Generation): Boxes indicating creation of documents. Documents could include forms, reports, approvals, permits, etc., needed throughout the process.
    “Genehmigungsworkflow” (Approval Workflow): This area shows multiple approval routes using diamonds (decision points). There appear to be different levels of approval depending on the type of activity. For example, one path may go through Quality Assurance (QAS), another through Legal, and so on.
    "Sicherheitscheck" (Safety Check): Multiple safety checks happening simultaneously. Could involve checking against databases for recalls, identifying potential risks, ensuring adherence to safety standards.
    “Finanzielle Überprüfung” (Financial Verification): Similar to other areas, this highlights verification of financing arrangements
